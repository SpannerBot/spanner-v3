# /server-info | Server Info

!!! tip "This feature is available everywhere!"

    This command is available in both a guild context, and user context! See
    [Installation](../0000-getting-started.md#1-installation) for more information!

!!! warning "Permissions required: bot"

    While this command works without many permissions, your information will be limited.
    The following information requires additional permissions:

    | Information        | Permission      |
    |--------------------|-----------------|
    | Auto moderation    | `Manage Server` |
    | Integrations       | `Manage Server` |
    | Invites            | `Manage Server` |
    | Vanity invite info | `Manage Server` |
    | Ban count          | `Ban Members`   |

    If you run this command in a server that the bot is not in, none of the above information will be available,
    as the bot has no permissions.

The server info command gives you a lot of in-depth information about the server you're in.

This command can give you a lot of information you cannot traditionally get from the discord UI,
and as such is split up into multiple "tabs" (unlike what Spanner v2 had, with one looooong page of information).

## Usage

```text
/server-info
```
